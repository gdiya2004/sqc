                                   ###limitations:
It's important to note that the HHL algorithm is designed specifically for certain types of linear equations, such as those with sparse matrices (majority of elements are zero  and dense matrix means where most of elements are non-zero)or other special properties. 
Additionally, implementing the HHL algorithm requires careful consideration of error correction and other quantum computing challenges to ensure accurate results.
 ###How classical computers solve them?
using variety of NUMERICAL METHODS depending on properties and size of system.
1.Direct Methods:series of arithmetic operations. GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION
2.Iterative Methods:approximate solution to system by iteratively improving initial guess. JACOBI METHOD:system split into diagonal and off-diagonal parts and iterative process is used to update solution until it converges to desired accuracy.
3.Matrix Faactorization:factorize coefficient matrix into simpler that can be manipulated ore easily. EIGEN VALUE DECOMPOSITION and SINGULAER VALUE DECOMPOSITION can be used to decompose matrix into eigen vectorss and singular vectors which can be used  to find soln.
4.Sparse Linear Solvers:dealing with large system with large matrices, specialised algorithms are used to take adv of this sparsity to reduce computational complexity.
